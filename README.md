This project deals with different aspects of tasks management like object pooling, event based programming, in memory queues.

This is java project build using gradle. So, to build it, one needs gradle installed.
I am trying to find how to integrate this with some build which can create jars online. This being my first contribution to Github, so not fully sure about the process.
